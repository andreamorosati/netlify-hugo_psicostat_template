This repository contains the website template created for members of [Psicostat](https://psicostat-template.netlify.com/). The idea is to simplify and adapt the awesome [Academic](https://sourcethemes.com/academic/) theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). There are some graphical and structural customization in particular for making the website clean and simple. The main goal is to have a personal website for academic needs but other sections and functions can be easily added.

## The repository

In the `master branch` there is the website structure with all files. In the `gh-pages branch` there is a simple documentation with information and commands for managing the website.
